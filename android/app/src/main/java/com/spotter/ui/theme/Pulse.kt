/**
 * The PULSE semantic layer: channel colors owned by data domains, the structural colors the
 * instrument-panel aesthetic is built from (hairline strokes, panel tones, glow), and the two
 * brand gradients.
 *
 * Channels — use them only where the meaning matches:
 *  - effort:   volume, work, active timers, primary actions (electric blue)
 *  - strength: PRs, loads, strength charts (violet)
 *  - streak:   consistency (orange)
 *  - recovery: rest, completion, success (green)
 *
 * Each channel has a `base` (strokes, text, rings), a `dim` (container fill — a pre-composited
 * solid, not an alpha, so hairlines drawn on top stay predictable) and an `on` (content atop the
 * base fill). Gradients are reserved for hero moments: [heroGradient] (blue → indigo) for the
 * greeting and primary CTAs is the signature; [energyGradient] (orange → amber) is the
 * celebration/streak voice. Provided through [LocalPulse] by SpotterTheme; pull via
 * `SpotterTheme.pulse`.
