.SYNOPSIS
  Redeploy the Spotter server from the canonical deployment clone (Windows / Docker Desktop).

.DESCRIPTION
  Pulls the requested ref, rebuilds the server image, restarts the stack, and waits
  for the API to report healthy. Idempotent and safe to re-run.

  This is the single source of redeploy logic — both the Deploy GitHub Actions
  workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and a human at the keyboard call it, so
  automated and manual deploys behave identically.

  The script resolves its own location to find the repo root, so it operates on the
  real deployment clone (which owns server/.env and the pgdata volume), never on a
  runner's ephemeral checkout. .env is gitignored and pgdata is a Docker named
  volume, so neither is touched by `git reset --hard`.

  Database migrations run automatically when the container starts
  (server/docker-entrypoint.sh -> alembic upgrade head); no separate step here.

.PARAMETER Ref
  Commit SHA or branch to deploy. Defaults to origin/main. Pass a prior SHA to roll back.

.PARAMETER HealthUrl
  Health endpoint to poll after restart. Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8000/health.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
  How long to wait for the health check before failing. Defaults to 120.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh deploy/redeploy.ps1

  pwsh deploy/redeploy.ps1 -Ref 1a2b3c4   # roll back to a prior commit
